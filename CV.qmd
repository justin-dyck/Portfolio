## Education

**M.Sc. -- Community Health Sciences** *Biostatistics Stream* <br> *University of Manitoba* [*Sep 2017 --- Dec 2019*]{.cvdate}

MSc thesis consisted of applying Bayesian Spatio-Temporal regression models to health data, to gain insight into chronic disease trends. Attention was given to spatial cluster detection, disease mapping, time-series analysis, and the modifiable areal unit problem/spatial change of support problem.
